# ME 318, Mechanical Vibrations

## Lab Reports:

[Double Pendulum Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncIsSG78-no)

Lab Overview:
- Performed free vibration testing of the Double Pendulum System in its Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) and Multiple Degree of Freedom (MDOF) Configurations
- Studied the effect of constructive and destructive interference, resulting in the vibratory phenomenon known as BEATS.

Lab Overview:
- Performed Sine Sweep and Random Noise testing on a cantilever beam using a shake table, accelerometer, and Spectrum Analyzer for data acquisition
- Performed Free Vibration Testing, determined the beam's fundamental natural frequency and associated damping using the log decrement method
- Studied the characteristics of Mode Superposition on this MDOF system

[Wing Structure Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXoxizYDwoM)

Lab Overview:
- Conducted Sine Sweep and Random Noise tests on a wing structure system, understanding the vibratory behavior of a more complex MDOF system

[Tuned Mass Damper Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8oZDUJnY4)

Lab Overview:
- Studied the governing EOMs for a MDOF cart-pendulum system, used for modeling a building structure installed with a Tuned Mass Damper
- Simulated the Tuned Mass Damper System in Matlab, specifically using ODE 45
