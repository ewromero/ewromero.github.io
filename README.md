## Welcome to Elias Romero's Portfolio!

[Home Page Link Here](https://ewromero.github.io/home.html)  

My most recent project I've worked on is this [Stent Fatigue Tester](https://www.cpempower.com/fdps?pgid=lnkl60a5-39d1a603-d68b-4beb-9e68-67054b906b6c) with EMPOWER (Endeavors to Move People Onwards With Engineered Results), a project-focused engineering club at Cal Poly.

### For future, create/add:
- HTML pages for each project I've done, including time range, description, CAD if applicable, skills learned
- Add in Vibes Lab Reports (with an overarching paragraph and 1-2 sentences for each lab report)
- add explanation paragraph for Stent Fatigue Project
- Maybe add ME 343 Lab Reports if they're good, to showcase my technical writing

ME 318 (Mechanical Vibrations) Lab Reports:
[Double Pendulum Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncIsSG78-no)
- In this lab, I performed free vibration testing of the Double Pendulum System in its Single Degree of Freedom (SDOF) and Multiple Degree of Freedom (MDOF) Configurations, to study the effect of constructive and destructive interference, resulting in the vibratory phenomenon known as BEATS. 

[Cantilever Beam Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOnmF88e5kQ)
Lab Overview:
- performed Sine Sweep and Random Noise testing on a cantilever beam using a shake table, accelerometer, and Spectrum Analyzer for data acquisition
- Performed Free Vibration Testing, determined the beam's fundamental natural frequency and associated damping using the log decrement method
- Studied the characteristics of Mode Superposition on this MDOF system

[Wing Structure Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cXoxizYDwoM)
Lab Overview:
- Conducted Sine Sweep and Random Noise tests on a wing structure system, understanding the vibratory behavior of a more complex MDOF system

[Tuned Mass Damper Lab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YX8oZDUJnY4)
Lab Overview:
- Studied the governing EOMs for a MDOF cart-pendulum system, used for modeling a building structure installed with a Tuned Mass Damper
- Simulated the Tuned Mass Damper System in Matlab, specifically using ODE 45
