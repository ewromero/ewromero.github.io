## Welcome to Elias Romero's Portfolio!


My most recent project I've worked on is this [Stent Fatigue Tester](https://www.cpempower.com/fdps?pgid=lnkl60a5-39d1a603-d68b-4beb-9e68-67054b906b6c) with EMPOWER (Endeavors to Move People Onwards With Engineered Results), a project-focused engineering club at Cal Poly.

### For future, create/add:
- HTML pages for each project I've done, including time range, description, CAD if applicable, skills learned
- add explanation paragraph for Stent Fatigue Project
- Maybe add ME 343 Lab Reports if they're good, to showcase my technical writing
