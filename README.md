## Welcome to Elias Romero's Portfolio!

[Home Page Link Here](https://ewromero.github.io/home.html)  

My most recent project I've worked on is this [Stent Fatigue Tester](https://www.cpempower.com/fdps?pgid=lnkl60a5-39d1a603-d68b-4beb-9e68-67054b906b6c) with EMPOWER (Endeavors to Move People Onwards With Engineered Results), a project-focused engineering club at Cal Poly.

### For future, create/add:
- HTML pages for each project I've done, including time range, description, CAD if applicable, skills learned 

Here is the link for my [ME 318 (Mechanical Vibrations) Double Pendulum Lab Report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncIsSG78-no)
